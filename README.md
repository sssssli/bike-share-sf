# bike-share-sf

Open source dataset from SF Bay Area Bike Share downloaded from [Kaggle.com (version 1.0)](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share)

Plan for this short little project:
 
1. Data visualizations, make some interesting insights from the data
2. Build a predictive model for guessing at bike availability per station 
3. Front end portal for end user to use
4. Through on AWS (optional)
5. API friendly (optional)
